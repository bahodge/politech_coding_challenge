## Tic Tack Toe

### How to run

## Dev Diary

This will acts as my development diary as I develop the application

### Setting up the project

- I rarely use plan old ruby projects, so setting up goes differently then "rails new"
- I created the directory structure along with installing 2 gems I know I'll be using, `rspec` and `values`
- Made initial script to be run to start the program. `bin/tic_tack_toe.rb`
